## üöÄ Next Steps

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets (Required)

Run the automated setup script:

```bash
./scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Upload your kubeconfig to GitHub secrets
- ‚úÖ Configure optional secrets
- ‚úÖ Update deployment files with your username
- ‚úÖ Verify all secrets are set correctly

**Or configure manually:**

```bash
# Encode and upload kubeconfig
cat ~/.kube/config | base64 | gh secret set KUBECONFIG

# List to verify
gh secret list
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Container Registry (Required)

1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devops/settings/actions`
2. Under "Workflow permissions":
   - ‚úÖ Select "Read and write permissions"
   - ‚úÖ Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
3. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Update Image References

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` in deployment files:

```bash
# Option 1: Use sed (quick)
GITHUB_USER="your-actual-username"
find k8s/personal -name "*deployment.yaml" -exec sed -i '' "s/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/$GITHUB_USER/g" {} \;

# Option 2: Manual edit
# Edit these files:
# - k8s/personal/backend-deployment.yaml
# - k8s/personal/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

### Step 4: Update README Badges

Edit `README.md` and replace `YOUR_USERNAME`:

```markdown
![Backend CI/CD](https://github.com/your-username/devops/actions/workflows/backend-cicd.yml/badge.svg)
![Frontend CI/CD](https://github.com/your-username/devops/actions/workflows/frontend-cicd.yml/badge.svg)
```

### Step 5: Test Locally (Recommended)

Before pushing, test everything locally:

```bash
./scripts/local-test.sh
```

This will catch issues before they reach CI/CD.

### Step 6: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: setup GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

### Step 7: Monitor the Pipeline

Watch your first deployment:

```bash
# Option 1: GitHub CLI
gh run watch

# Option 2: Browser
# Visit: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devops/actions
```

### Step 8: Verify Deployment

After the pipeline completes:

```bash
# Run verification script
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh

# Or manually check
kubectl get pods -n backend
kubectl get pods -n frontend
```

## üîç Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Backend Pipeline
```bash
echo "// Test" >> backend/main.go
git add backend/main.go
git commit -m "test: trigger backend pipeline"
git push origin main
gh run watch
```

### Test 2: Frontend Pipeline

echo "/* Test */" >> frontend/src/App.js
git add frontend/src/App.js
git commit -m "test: trigger frontend pipeline"
git push origin main
gh run watch
```

### Test 3: Manual Deployment
```bash
gh workflow run deploy-stack.yml --field environment=production
gh run watch
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: KUBECONFIG secret not found
**Solution:**
```bash
./scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh
# Or manually:
cat ~/.kube/config | base64 | gh secret set KUBECONFIG
```

### Issue: Permission denied to push to GHCR
**Solution:**
1. Check repository settings > Actions > General
2. Ensure "Read and write permissions" is enabled
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### Issue: Workflow doesn't trigger
**Solution:**
1. Ensure you're pushing to main/master/develop
2. Check that changed files match the path filters
3. Verify workflows are enabled in Actions tab

### Issue: Deployment timeout
**Solution:**
```bash
kubectl describe pod -n backend <pod-name>
kubectl logs -n backend deployment/backend-api
kubectl get events -n backend --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

### Issue: Tests fail in CI but pass locally
**Solution:**
- Check Go/Node versions match CI
- Verify all dependencies are committed
- Check for environment-specific code

## üìà Success Metrics

Your CI/CD is working correctly when:

- ‚úÖ Workflows trigger on appropriate file changes
- ‚úÖ All tests pass in CI environment
- ‚úÖ Docker images build successfully
- ‚úÖ Security scans complete without critical issues
- ‚úÖ Images are pushed to GHCR
- ‚úÖ Kubernetes deployments succeed
- ‚úÖ Health checks pass after deployment
- ‚úÖ Services are accessible via kubectl/port-forward

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Always test locally first**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/local-test.sh
   ```

2. **Use semantic commit messages**
   - feat: new feature
   - fix: bug fix
   - docs: documentation
   - test: testing
   - chore: maintenance

3. **Monitor deployments**
   ```bash
   gh run watch
   ```

4. **Verify after deployment**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
   ```

5. **Use pull requests for important changes**
   - Triggers PR checks
   - Allows code review
   - Prevents direct issues

1. ‚úÖ Run tests and linting
2. üê≥ Build Docker images
3. üîí Scan for security vulnerabilities
4. üì¶ Push to GitHub Container Registry
5. üöÄ Deploy to Kubernetes
